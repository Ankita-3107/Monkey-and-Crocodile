Once upon a time, there lived a monkey who lived in a jamun tree near the river bank. In the same forest, lived a crocodile and his wife.
One day the crocodile came to the river and rested under the tree. The kind-hearted monkey offered him the fruits. The crocodile came back the 
next day as he loved the fruits.
